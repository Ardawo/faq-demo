A047,"Please note the following three points when using kibaco. <br> <br> 1. In order to use kibaco, you first need to acquire the ID of 'Information System for Education and Research'. Please apply for the right to use kibaco when you apply for ID acquisition. In addition, teachers who have already acquired an ID may not have acquired the right to use kibaco. In this case, please apply for the right to use kibaco. <br> 2. The teacher in charge of class will be registered to the class course based on the timetable and syllabus. If only the main teacher is listed in the timetable and syllabus, or if the teacher is listed as 'all teachers' (no names of the teachers), not all teachers may be registered in the course. Also, if the part-time teacher is the primary teacher, the full-time teacher will not be automatically registered in the course on the system specifications. <br> 3. Only the year when part-time teacher is changed to full-time teacer may not be registered automatically. <br> <br> For the cases where teachers are not registered described as 2. and 3, see <a href = "http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/e-learning/faq/add-teacher.html" target = "_ blank">here</a>."
A048,"Part-time teachers can also use kibaco. In order to use kibaco, please acquire the user ID of 'Information System for Education and Research' and apply for the right to use kibaco. For part-time teachers, application for course registration is required for each course each year."
A049,"The changes about any class information are not reflected to kibaco as it is based on the information for about one month after starting the new semester. If you are no longer in charge of class, you will need to cancel your registration. To cancel registration, send an application email (subject name, class number, name of teacher to cancel, system ID for education and research of teacher to cancel) to the system management room 2 (replace ● with an at-mark of e-learning-ml ● ml.tmu.ac.jp) It is necessary to send the information system ID for education and research from the main teacher, or send it to the CC."
A050,"Even if you are not a regular student, you can use kibaco if you have been issued a User ID for 'Information System for Educational Research'. If you are a research student or special course student, and you have not acquired this user ID, please apply first. In addition, the teacher in charge of the class may apply for the class ID and may use the issued ID for the audience and subjects who have taken courses."
A051,"If you cannot see the course, please check the following points. <br> 1. Make sure that you are enrolled in the course corresponding to the subject. Usually, you are registered for the course once you applied for the registration. <br> 2. There is a case that there is a class tab in '-continued-' at the top of the screen. You can change the order and number of tabs displayed here. For teachers, see the 'Sort the order of the displayed lesson tabs' and 'set the number of displayed lesson tabs' in the 'screen setting function' section of <a href="http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/e-learning/faq/add-teacher.html" target="_blank">the manual for Teacher</a> or <a href="http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/e-learning/faq/add-teacher.html" target="_blank">the manual for Student</a>. <br> 3.

If it is set, it will be displayed by setting it to 'Class displayed in tab' (The details are <a href = "http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/e-learning/files/kibaco_teacher1_20161017.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">page 15 of the manual for Teacher</a> or <a href = "http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/e-learning/files/kibaco_student1_20161017.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">page 14 of the manual for Student</a>). <br> 4. kibaco does not show all subjects registered for the course. Please ask the teacher in charge of the class as the class may not display in the case where the teacher who do not use kibaco. <br> 5. If you applied for the course on the day of class, it will not be displayed because it is not reflected in kibaco immediately. It will be reflected the next morning after applying."
A052,"For students who have applied for the course, the course status of the 'Class Information' function will be displayed as 'Full Registration'. On the other hand, if the teacher manually registers the student or if the student is registered for the course by cls-registration, 'provisional registration' is displayed. You can use the kibaco course even for provisionally registration, but you cannot earn credits if you do not apply separately. <br> In the following cases, students will remain tentatively registered. <br> 1. Non-regular students such as course students and research students. If it is necessary to change the display to this registration, from the teacher in charge of office work or classes such as the education affairs division or the international affairs division system management room 2 (replace ● with an at-mark of e-learning-ml ● ml.tmu.tc.jp). <br> 2. If you create a course on kibaco that is not registered in the clerical information system. <br> <br> When registering a student as a 'TA/Tutor', give 'TA/Tutor' authority when registering a student in 'Register Students or TA' of 'Class Information' function.

The materials need to be prepared by the teacher."
A053,"The results of applying for the course will be reflected in kibaco at 5-6 o'clock in the morning. If you apply for the course on the day of the class, it will be reflected the next morning. <br> In addition, there are subjects that are not displayed in the kibaco timetable, so check the results of the course application with CAMPUS SQUARE instead of kibaco."
A054,"If a provisionally registered student applies for a course, it will be changed to full registration the next day. If a provisionally registered student does not apply for the course, it will remain provisionally registered even after the course application period. Class teachers can unregister students from the course for provisionally registration. However, in the following cases, students are still provisionally registered even if they have applied for the course. <br> 1. Non-regular students such as course students and research students. If it is necessary to change the display to this registration, the teacher in charge of the class or office workers of the education affairs division or the international affairs division contacts system management room 2 (replace ● with an at-mark of e-learning-ml ● ml.tmu.ac.jp). <br> 2. If you create a course on kibaco that is not registered in the clerical information system. <br> Students who are officially registered will be canceled from the course only if the students withdraw from the course application."
A055,"By enrolling students in courses that correspond to the subjects, students can gain access to the courses even before applying for courses. One of the registration methods is to allow students to cls-registration and make them do it for the course. The teacher in charge of each class can set whether or not to cls-register for the course. Even if the student wants to cls-register, he/she cannot do cls-registration unless the teacher in charge of the class sets it. In addition, first-year undergraduate students cannot use kibaco until they take an information ethics class in the first class of the Information Literacy Practice I/IA. For details, see <a href="http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/e-learning//files/kibaco_teacher1_20161017.pdf#page=34" target="_blank">page 34 of the manual for Teacher</a>."
A056,"If you apply for a course that you have cls-registered, withdrawal from the course application will cancel your registration from the course. In addition, if you do not apply for courses you have registered for cls-registration, you can cancel your cls-registration by yourself. However, if the teacher in charge of the class consolidates the courses and the cls-registered course is a secondary course, the course application will not be canceled even if the course application is withdrawn. If you need to cancel the registration, please contact the system administration room 2 (replace ● with an at-mark of e-learning-ml ● ml.tmu.ac.jp)."
A057,"In kibaco, a course (class tab) is created for each class number. Even if the courses are offered on the same day of the week, time limit, or classroom, the course is divided into multiple courses in the case that different course numbers are assigned depending on the year of entry or affiliation (undergraduate or graduate school). If you are teaching a course that is divided into multiple courses as essentially the same course, you can organize those courses by applying. This process of summarizing is called subject concentration. By consolidating the courses, you will be able to manage lesson materials, manage student scoring results, etc. with one designated main course. The processing applied to the main subject course is not reflected in the secondary subject course. <br> <br> The teacher who wants to consolidate subjects see <a href="http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/e-learning/faq/integrate-sites.html" target="_blank">here</a>."
A058,"If you consolidate the subjects, you cannot cancel them."
A059,"When the subjects are consolidated, 'Subsidiary Classes' will be displayed in the courses of the secondary subjects other than the subjects specified as the main subject. In addition, only the teacher can access the course of the secondary subject, and the student cannot access it. Moreover, the teacher in charge of classes can also hide the tab of the secondary subject course."
A060,"At kibaco, a course will be created for each class number. Even if the courses are offered on the same day of the week, time limit, or class, the course is divided into multiple courses in the case that different class numbers are assigned depending on the year of admission or affiliation (undergraduate or graduate school). It is possible to combine the subjects into one."
A061,"When subjects are consolidated, students who have been registered as minor subjects will also be automatically enrolled as main subjects. After the subjects are consolidated, they will access the main subjects only. In addition, since the secondary subjects will be hidden from the students after concentration, the students will not accidentally register or access the secondary subjects."

A063,"There is no attendance management function in kibaco. You can make a pseudo attendance check by creating a topic on the bulletin board or creating an assignment for attendance management."
A064,"There are five ways to communicate information to all students: 'notice', 'bulletin board', 'message', 'class information', and 'wiki.' For the first two functions, a disclosure period can be set to convey information such as cancellation information. In addition, teachers, TAs and students (including provisionally registrations) can be notified by contacting all participants. If you set the option to notify as e-mail, you can notify as e-mail. Information on how to receive classes can use 'class information' and 'wiki'. There are three functions that the students can use to communicate information to the whole class: 'bulletin board', 'message' and 'wiki.' Details of the instruction manual for the bulletin board are <a href="http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/e-learning/files/kibaco_teacher1_20161017.pdf#page=85" target="_blank">pages 85-89 of the manual for Teacher</a>, for more information about the message <a href="http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/e-learning/files/kibaco_teacher1_20161017.pdf#page=119" target="_blank">pages 119-122 of the manual for Teacher</a>, for more information on announcements <a href="http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/e-learning/files/kibaco_teacher1_20161017.pdf#page=41" target="_blank">pages 41-43 of the manual for Teacher</a>, and <a href=" http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/e-learning/files/kibaco_teacher1_20161017.pdf#page=106" target ="_blank">pages 106 to 109 of the manual for Teacher</a>."
A065,"By using the message function, you can send a message to students including provisionally registration in a way such as all students, only specified groups, or only specified (multiple) students. The message is sent and received within kibaco, so if you want to send the message as an e-mail, you need to check 'Send as e-mail.' For details, see <a href="http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/e-learning/files/kibaco_teacher1_20161017.pdf#page=119" target="_blank">pages 119 ~ 122 of the manual for Teacher</a>."
A066,"The message function is hidden by default.

Add/delete functions' in 'Class Information Function')."
A067,"Messages will only be exchanged within kibaco unless 'Send as email' is checked. Even if 'Send as E-mail' is checked, email address information will not be leaked to anyone other than the recipient. Even if you send a message in a batch, it is possible for only students and teachers registered for the corse to receive the message. Thus, students who have not taken this course or teachers who have not registered cannot view the content. When sending a message to multiple students as an email, the email addresses of other students will be displayed. You can create a group of students you want to send, and send the message to that group. If a teacher sends a message to the group, only the name of the group is displayed excluding the individual email addresses of the recipients, so it is possible to prevent email address information disclosure among students."
A068,"Only users registered in the course can view the notice. If you set the usage period in the 'Display days limit,' students cannot view the notice before or after the period. The details are <a href="http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/e-learning/files/kibaco_teacher1_20161017.pdf#page=41" target="_blank">pages 41 ~ 44 of the manual for Teacher</a>."
